Find Me Starbucks
========

A nice and simple watchface app to demonstrate the exciting potential in combining the Pebblekit JavaScript Framework with web APIs. In this case, I've combined the FourSquare API with Pebble's location tracking to tell a user at all times where their nearest Starbucks is.

Not a fan of Starbucks? No worries, create your own watchface that directs you to McDonald's, Subway, Anytime Fitness... anything really that's on FourSquare. It's fun.

If you extend this or make something completely different based off this original code example, please do let me know! I'd love to see where you take the Pebblekit JavaScript Framework and the huge number of APIs on the web! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.

Best of luck,
